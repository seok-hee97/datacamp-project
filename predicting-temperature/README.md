### Predicting-Temperature

---

#### Perform a machine learning experiment to find the best model that predicts the temperature in London!

---
Project Description: As the climate changes around the world, the ability to predict changing weather is becoming more and more important.

Predicting the mean temperature in London is the main focus:
- Import, preprocess, and explore historical weather data and automate the training and evaluation of multiple machine-learning models.
- Setup an automated workflow using functions, utilizing methods from sklearn and MLflow.

Project Tasks
- Use MLflow to log training runs for a model that predicts mean temperature in London!
