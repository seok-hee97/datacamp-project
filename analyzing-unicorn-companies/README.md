## Analyzing Unicorn Companies


### Project Instructions

Your task is to first identify the three best-performing industries based on the number of new unicorns created in 2019, 2020, and 2021 combined.

From those industries (1), you will need to find the number of unicorns within these industries (2), the year that they became a unicorn (3), and their average valuation, converted to billions of dollars and rounded to two decimal places (4).

With the above information you can then finish your query to return a table containing industry, year, num_unicorns, and average_valuation_billions. For readability, the firm have asked you to sort your results by year and number of unicorns, both in descending order.

Note: If you use multiple SQL cells then please ensure your final query containing the desired output is stored as a pandas DataFrame called df at the top of the cell so that your answer can be validated:
